            Ha!

            We're taking over the world
            One kiss at a time
            And then I'm taking your girl
            And I'm making her mine

            No reason why
            I'm only doing anything I want to do
            Because I do it all the time

            We're taking over the world
            A little victim-less crime
            And when I'm taking your innocence
            I'll be corrupting your mind
            
            No need to cry
            I'm only doing anything I want to do
            Because I do it all the time
            (Do it all the time)
            
            Now we're so young
            But we're probably gonna die
            It's so fun
            We're so good at selling lies
            We look so good
            And we never even try
            Get your money from a trust fund
            Do it all the time
            
            Ha!

            I don't wanna do it, but I do it
            'Cause I do it all the time

        <h2>"Why would you only call me when you're high" - Artic Monkeys</h2>
        <audio src="arquivos/Music2.mp3" controls></audio>
        
        <pre>
            The mirror's image
            Tells me it's home time
            But I'm not finished
            'Cause you're not by my side

            And as I arrive I thought I saw you leaving
            Carrying your shoes
            Decided that once again I was just dreaming
            Of bumping into you

            Now it's three in the morning
            And I'm trying to change your mind
            Left you multiple missed calls
            And to my message you replied
            Why'd you only call me when you're high?
            Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?

            Somewhere darker
            Talking the same shite
            I need a partner (aah)
            Well, are you out tonight?

            It's harder and harder to get you to listen
            More I get through the gears
            Incapable of making alright decisions
            And having bad ideas

            Now it's three in the morning
            And I'm trying to change your mind
            Left you multiple missed calls
            And to my message you replied (message you replied)
            Why'd you only call me when you're high?
            (Why'd you only call me when you're)
            Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?

            And I can't see you here, wonder where am I (am I)
            It sort of feels like I am running out of time (time, time)
            I haven't found what I was hoping to find (find)

            You said you gotta be up in the morning
            Gonna have an early night
            And you're starting to bore me, baby
            Why'd you only call me when you're high?

            Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
            Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
            Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
            Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

        <h2>"In One Ear" - Cage the Elephant</h2>
        <audio src="arquivos/Music3.mp3" controls></audio>

        <pre>
            They say that we ain't got the style
            We ain't got the class
            We ain't got the tunes that's goin to put us on the map
            And I'm a phony in disguise
            Tryin to make the radio
            I'm an anti-social anarchist dyslexic so and so
            They say I'm just a stupid kid
            Another crazy radical
            Rock and roll is dead I probably should've stayed in school
            Another generation x who somehow slipped up through the cracks
            They'd love to see me fall but I'm already on my back

            So it goes in one ear
            And right out the other
            People talkin' shit but you know I never bother
            In one ear
            And right out the other
            People talkin' shit
            They can kiss the back of my hand

            Now I know I'm not a saint
            I been a sinner all my life
            I ain't tryin to hide my flaws
            I'd rather keep them in the light
            They wanna criticise, scrutinize
            Cast another stone
            Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from their throne
            They say the devil is my pal
            I do alotta drugs!
            The crowd will only like me if they're really fuckin' drunk!
            They think they know my thoughts
            But they don't know the least
            If they listened to the words they'd find the message tucked beneath

            And it goes..in one ear
            And right out the other
            People talkin shit even though they never bother
            It goes in one ear
            And right out the other
            People talkin' shit,they can kiss the back of my hand!

            (You hear that, you hear what's coming?
            Oh, you better run for the hills
            Cause we're coming to your town
            And we're gonna burn that mother fucker down!)

            Here's the moral to the story
            We don't do it for the glory
            We don't do it for the money
            We don't do it for the things
            So all the critics who despise, just go ahead and criticise
            It's your tyranny that drives us, addin' fire to the flame

            And it goes,in one ear
            And right out the other
            People talkin' shit but you know we'll never bother
            It goes in one ear
            And right out the other
            I'm only playing music cos you know I fuckin' love it
            And it goes in one ear
            And right out the other
            People talkin' shit but you know we'll never bother
            It goes in one ear, and right out the other, people talkin shit well you know they can kiss the back of my hand
